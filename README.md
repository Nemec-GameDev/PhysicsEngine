Both of the files have been zipped/compressed using '7zip'. If you are struggling
to unconpress the files, please use '7zip'.

Code is written in C++

Installation
----------------------------
Build:
  1) Unzip the file
  2) Find "Physics.exe" and run it
  3) Done

Source Code
  1) Unzipe the file
  2) Find "Timestep.sln" and open it
  3) Done

Use
----------------------------
Build:
The build is a demonstration of the physics engine. You interact with the big ball
by pressing 'Left-Mouse Button'. This will add force to the ball in the direction
of the red line (i.e. mouse to ball). Knock thing around and view the physics.

Source Code:
Once in "Timestep.sln" you can build it via the "Local Windows Debugger" button.
All source code that is not 'Bootstrap' can be found under the "Physics" project in
the 'Solution Explorer'.
